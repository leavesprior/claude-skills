## Phase 1: Data Collection

### Airbnb Data Export Process

1. **Navigate to Host Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://www.airbnb.com/hosting
   - Use Playwright MCP: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`

2. **Download Transaction Data:**
   - Go to: Earnings > Transaction History
   - Select filter: "Year-to-date" for full year
   - Click "Get CSV report" button
   - Save to: `/home/granny/.playwright-mcp/`

3. **Download PDF Summary:**
   - Click "Download PDF" for visual earnings report
   - Useful for quick overview and verification

### Data Sources

```json
{
  "airbnb_csv": "Transaction history with dates, nights, gross earnings, fees",
  "airbnb_pdf": "Visual earnings summary report",
  "airbnb_calendar": "Real-time availability and current pricing"
}
```

---

## Phase 2: BOBR Metrics Analysis

### Key Metrics to Calculate

```python
# Core Metrics
total_gross_earnings = sum(gross_earnings)
total_nights_booked = sum(nights)
average_daily_rate = total_earnings / total_nights
average_stay_length = total_nights / reservation_count
occupancy_rate = (nights_booked / available_nights) * 100
revpan = earnings / available_nights  # Revenue Per Available Night
```

### Distribution Analysis

- **Check-in Day Distribution:** Count check-ins by day of week (target: Friday < 40%)
- **Stay Length Distribution:** Bucket stays into 2-night, 3-night, 4+ categories
- **Seasonal ADR:** Calculate ADR by month to find peak/low seasons

### Analysis Script Location

```bash
# Python analysis script
/media/granny/larger SSD/Neoma_project/memory/bobr_analysis.py

# Output files
/media/granny/larger SSD/Neoma_project/memory/BOBR_pricing_analysis_*.json
```

---

## Phase 3: Tetris Calendar Analysis

### The Tetris Problem

Like Tetris, bad booking placement creates unbookable gaps:

```
PROBLEM PATTERN:
[Fri][Sat][___][___][___][___][___] <- 2-night weekend booking
              ^--- 5 empty nights (Sun-Thu)

TETRIS ANALOGY:
Bad piece placement = Unbookable gap nights
```

### Weak Spots to Identify

| Pattern | Current | Target | Issue |
|---------|---------|--------|-------|
| Friday check-in % | 45.2% | <40% | Too concentrated |
| 2-night stay % | 52.4% | <40% | Creates Sun checkout |
| Midweek booking % | 28.5% | >35% | Mon-Wed underutilized |

### Visual Verification

Use Playwright MCP to check Airbnb Calendar UI:
- Pink blocks = Booked nights
- White blocks = Available nights
- Look for: Sun-Thu empty patterns after weekend bookings

---

## Phase 4: Competitive Analysis

### RankBreeze Integration

```json
{
  "url": "https://app.rankbreeze.com/rankings/32104",
  "listing_id": "32104",
  "metrics": ["search_rank", "rank_history", "competitor_comparison", "keyword_performance"]
}
```

### What to Track

- Current search ranking position
- Ranking trends over time
- Competitor pricing comparison
- Keyword performance for listing

### Credentials

```bash
# View stored credentials
bobr-creds view

# Edit credentials
bobr-creds edit
```

---

## Phase 5: Reverse Weekend Bundle Strategy

### Core Concept

Instead of premium Fri-Sat, create attractive Sun-Mon-Tue bundles to fill gaps.

### Day-of-Week Pricing

| Day | Adjustment | Rate | Rationale |
|-----|------------|------|-----------|
| Friday | +20% | $289 | High demand, maximize revenue |
| Saturday | +25% | $301 | Highest demand, premium pricing |
| Sunday | -10% | $217 | Incentive to extend stay |
| Monday | -15% | $205 | Deep discount for midweek |
| Tuesday | -15% | $205 | Deep discount for midweek |
| Wednesday | -10% | $217 | Moderate discount, bridge to weekend |
| Thursday | base | $241 | Transition to weekend premium |

### Bundle Packages

```json
{
  "reverse_weekend_3_night": {
    "nights": "Sun + Mon + Tue",
    "individual_total": 627,
    "bundle_price": 549,
    "savings_percent": "12%"
  },
  "extended_escape_4_night": {
    "nights": "Sun + Mon + Tue + Wed",
    "individual_total": 844,
    "bundle_price": 719,
    "savings_percent": "15%"
  },
  "full_week_value": {
    "nights": "Sun through Sat",
    "individual_total": 1675,
    "bundle_price": 1339,
    "savings_percent": "20%"
  }
}
```

### Minimum Stay Rules

- **Fri-Sat:** 2-night minimum (prevent single Saturday blocking Friday)
- **Sun-Thu:** 1-night minimum allowed (maximize fill rate)
- **Major Holidays:** 3-night minimum (capture full demand)

---

## Phase 6: Implementation Options

### Option A: Manual Calendar Adjustment

1. Go to Airbnb Calendar
2. Select dates
3. Edit pricing manually
4. **Pros:** Free, immediate
5. **Cons:** Time-consuming, no automation

### Option B: PriceLabs Free Tier

```json
{
  "base_rate": 241,
  "min_price": 180,
  "max_price": 450,
  "day_of_week": {
    "Mon": -15, "Tue": -15, "Wed": -10,
    "Thu": 0, "Fri": 20, "Sat": 25, "Sun": -10
  },
  "last_minute_discount": {
    "7_days": -10, "3_days": -15, "1_day": -20
  }
}
```

### Option C: Airbnb Rule-Sets

1. Create new rule-set
2. Define seasonal rates
3. Apply to calendar
4. **Warning:** Avoid 4+ overlapping promotions (causes price erosion)

## Phase 7: Monitoring & KPIs

### Weekly KPI Review

| KPI | Current | Target | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| Occupancy Rate | 40% | 55-60% | Below target |
| ADR | $240.61 | $220-240 | On target |
| RevPAN | $96.25 | $120-130 | Below target |
| Midweek Booking % | 28.5% | 40%+ | Below target |
| Gap Nights/Month | High | -50% | Needs improvement |

### Adjustment Triggers

- Occupancy drops below 45%
- ADR drops below $200
- Midweek fills don't improve after 2 weeks

### Review Schedule

- **Weekly:** First month after implementation
- **Monthly:** Ongoing after stabilization
